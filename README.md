# ubuntu-vscode-update

Visual Studio Code doesn't have an auto update feature for Linux, and I'm not motivated enough to set up a repository for updates. So, here's a quick and dirty bash script that can be used to update every so often.

## Installation

Just copy this file somewhere, make sure it's executable, and set in root crontab - that's it!

## Requirements

* `curl` to fetch remote resources
